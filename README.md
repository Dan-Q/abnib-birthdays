# Abnib Birthdays

Middleman-powered static website to produce a list of upcoming birthdays/anniversaries etc. and RSS/Atom and iCal feeds for them. See it at https://abnib.co.uk/.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Edit `data/birthdays.yml` if necessary
3. `middleman build` to compile or `middleman` to run a local webserver

OR with Vagrant installed, run `vagrant up` to provision and launch a VM that runs middleman on http://localhost:4567/: probably easier that wrangling Middleman's binary dependencies if you're using Windows.

## Jen, Get Back To Work!

For reasons of laziness, this same repo powers https://JenGetBackTo.Work/. See compiled file `jen.html` for the video player produced.

## Abnib Quotes

Long ago, we kept humourous quotes on the RockMonkey Wiki (you might be able to find otherwise lost ones in [this repo](https://github.com/rock-monkey/rock-monkey.github.io)). Later, we had a system called Abnib Quotes to store them. There were well over a thousand in its heyday, and a few of these - recovered using the WayBack Machine - can now be found at https://abnib.co.uk/quotes.html.
