          Claire: Right; that's it. I'm making a Facebook friend group called "Actual Friends."<br>Dan: Why don't you just actually only add friends to your friends list if they're actually your friends?<br>Claire: You can't just tell somebody "No, I'm not going to be your Facebook friend."<br>Dan: Yes you can. And I do. I add people to my friends list if I might ever want to speak to them again, not because Facebook tells me that we have 16 friends in common.<br>Claire: It doesn't work like that. You don't add people to your friends list because you want to talk to them when you obviously don't, you add them to your friends list so that Facebook shares all the personal information with them that you don't want them to have.
